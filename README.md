## How to Contribute as a Developer

Follow these steps to contribute to the project:

1. **Clone Both Repositories.**

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/backend-repository.git
   ```

2. **Create a New Folder for the Frontend Feature.**
   - Navigate to the `app` directory of the frontend.
   - Create a new folder named after your feature (e.g., `calendar`).
   ```bash

   cd frontend/app/calendar
   touch page.js
   ```

3. **Ensure Code Modularity.**
   - Create a directory for any components related to your feature.

   ```

4. **Write Backend Controller Code.**
   - Create a new controller file for your feature in the backend.
   ```bash
   mkdir backend/src/controllers/yourToolName
   cd backend/src/controllers/yourToolName
   touch controller.js
   ```

5. **Add Routes to the Backend.**
   - In `backend/src/routes/index.js`, add routes for your feature.
   ```javascript
   // In backend/src/routes/index.js
   const yourToolController = require('../controllers/yourToolName/controller');

   router.get('/your-route', yourToolController.yourFunction);
   ```

6. **Commit Your Changes.**
   - Stage your changes and commit with a clear message.
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add [your feature] to frontend and backend"
   ```

7. **Push Your Changes.**
